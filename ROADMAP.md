🛣️ Roadmap – Project C.O.R.E.
A global, behavioral, and symbolic evolution simulator hidden inside Minecraft — with the long-term goal of creating a scientifically useful predictive engine.

🧱 Phase 1 – Foundation (using MCreator)
 Build a symbolic solo world base (inspired by ORBOROS)

 Implement a global behavioral values system using NBT variables

 Generate structures and environmental effects based on player stats

 Create adaptive Oracle-like NPCs

 Add dynamic events tied to human-like behaviors (conflict, peace, famine, etc.)

 Add a visual interface (book, screen, NPC dialogue) to show the simulated "Humanity Stats"

🌐 Phase 2 – Multiplayer Simulation (prototype)
 Create a test server for 10–50 players

 Sync player behavior globally across all sessions

 Observe early social patterns: alliances, betrayals, isolation

 Implement per-player behavioral memory tracking

 Introduce a simple adaptive AI responding to behavioral changes

🧠 Phase 3 – Intelligence & Complexity
 Connect the game to an external AI engine

 Let the AI analyze player behavior shifts over time

 Start building a behavior prediction module

 Enable dynamic future events (predicted betrayals, preemptive wars, etc.)

 Make the world fully dynamic, shaped by humanity’s symbolic balance

🌍 Phase 4 – Cross-Reality System
 Allow players to travel between parallel worlds

 Generate alternate worlds based on different humanity outcomes

 Build a shared symbolic thread between realities (mirror effects)

🔭 Phase 5 – Real-Life Application
 Build an external tool for analyzing in-game human behavior

 Evaluate the scientific relevance of the simulation

 Develop a real-world module for psychology, criminology, or social sciences

 Launch a public research experiment using volunteers in-game

💡 Ongoing Goals
 Keep gameplay smooth, beautiful, and symbolic

 Ensure deep systems are still readable and engaging

 Document all systems for public collaboration

 Keep the project fully open-source and community-driven
