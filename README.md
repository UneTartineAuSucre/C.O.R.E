Languages: I prefer French, but if you’re fluent in English or French and very motivated, feel free to contact me!
Important: I don’t know how to code. I don’t have technical tools.
👉 What I do have: vision, ideas, and the will to go beyond what's possible.

🌀 The Vision
C.O.R.E. isn’t just a Minecraft mod.
It’s a behavioral, symbolic, and predictive simulation engine — a world that evolves with you, watches you, and maybe one day… understands you.

This is my biggest and most ambitious project. I’m starting from almost nothing except a head full of strange, complex, and sometimes beautiful ideas.

🧩 What C.O.R.E. Is About
Tracks and analyzes everything the player does (movement, combat, crafting, dialogue…)

Builds a live behavioral profile

Changes the world procedurally in real time:
Climate, mobs, loot, quests, dimensions, NPCs, structures, difficulty…

Translates Minecraft actions into real-world metaphors (mining = resource exploitation, killing = violence index…)

Uses this data to try and predict the player's future decisions

Offers unique symbolic events, quests, and narrative paths for every player

Designed to simulate society-scale behavior using just one player as input

And later, I want to go beyond games — toward science, criminology, social analysis, and predictive systems in real life.

🚧 What I Don’t Have (Yet)
I don’t know how to code (at all).

I don’t have a dev team.

I don’t have money, a server, or technical tools.

I only have raw ideas, sketches, and a vision.

But I’m ready to learn, build, and collaborate.

🔥 Who I’m Looking For
Minecraft modders (MCreator or Java)

AI engineers or behavior modelers

Symbolic system designers and philosophers

Curious devs who want to push beyond “just a game”

🌍 Why This Matters
What if a video game could reflect human nature?
What if we could observe, understand, and predict ourselves through play?

This is more than a mod — this is a mirror, a lens, and a potential tool for real-world insight.
